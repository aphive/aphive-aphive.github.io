About 2 weeks ago I had some electrical work done on my house and had two new outlet drops added in my home office so I can install some much needed equipment. Together with that I also got a new breaker box installed to expand the capacity for future expansion if and when needed.For some reason it seems like there was some interference from the new drops that was causing networking not to work at all. Once I moved things back to an older outlet, it started working again. I know… WTH??? I had the same reaction.I did some investigation on my end and it seems that there was something somewhere interfering with networking signals across my networking gear. At first I thought a surge in voltage but nothing seems to be overheating or flaking in any way and there was no shorting happening no matter what I plugged in. Through the investigations as noted earlier, I tried moving hardware to both new outlets as well as a different outlet in the same room and both the new outlets did the same thing.After a few days of looking into things on my end I spoke the contractor and explained my thoughts and findings and we agreed that there should be something electrical causing this so we tried turning off one of the breakers and guess what? Things worked just fine. We switched over to the other breaker and things again worked fine. We left one breaker off until the electrician could come in and look into it. It was agreed that someone would come in a few days to do some testing, so we wait.I got someone out quickly and they did some voltage testing and it seems like all was well but we did confirm that when both breakers were in the on position at the same time, my equipment power on but networking does not work. Once one breaker is turned off it started working again. Once again we left one breaker powered off and things functioning.The electrician explained to me that when they installed the two outlets there was as normally done, one neutral shared between both and this seems to have cause some cross talk happening so we scheduled yet another appointment for the crew to come back out and run another neutral so each outlet can be a unique circuit. That day came and went and things have remained stable." }, { "title": "Linux on older CPUs with PAE", "url": "/posts/linux_pae_error/", "categories": "Linux, 32bit", "tags": "linux, 32bit, pae", "date": "2022-02-11 08:10:00 -0600", "snippet": "On machines with older Pentium M ™ and Celeron M ™ processors, there is an extra requirement to get Linux installed, I’ve encountered this mainly with Linux Lite as that is the OS of choice I use for older systems. You can only install 32bit OSs on these CPUs.I recently had someone ask if they could install an OS on one of these machines and I had to look this up again. I am still in the process to get this machine up and running but will wupdate the post once I get to end of job whatever the case, be it installed or not. This only works if your installation is failing with this error:kernel requires features not present on the CPU: PAEOnce you get to the boot menu screen, make sure Start Linux Lite is highlighted then press Tab ↹, this will bring up a command line with -- at the end.Add forcepae to the string before and after the two dashes like so: forcepae -- forcepae.Press return, and the installation begins. You may get a warning about forcepae being experimental, just proceeed with your install. The “forcepae” option must be entered twice, before and after the delimiter “–“, so that it is applied to both the kernel on the ISO and the kernel on the system after installation.After booting, run this check from terminal:dmesg | grep -i paeThe return should show PAE forced!So what is PAE anyway?Physical Address Extension (PAE) is a memory management extension that enables a 32-bit Intel (IA-32) compatible processor to address more than 4 GB of physical memory that was first released in 1995 with the introduction of the Intel Pentium Pro and today is supported in all recent processors and operating systems.A number of older Pentium M ™ processors produced around 2003-4 (the Banias family) do not display the PAE flag, and hence a normal installation fails. However, these processors are in fact able to run the latest (and PAE-demanding) kernels if only the installation process is modified a little. The problem is not missing PAE, it’s about the processor not displaying its full capabilities.In spite of their age many of the affected computers (IBM Thinkpads and Dell Latitudes, for example) are suitable for today’s use if given a light distro like Linux Lite, Xubuntu or Lubuntu; among other advantages they have a low power consumption. This guide describes a workaround for installing Linux Lite and bringing your aging machine back to life – actually the guide can be modified to work for any member of the Ubuntu family, but because we are dealing with old hardware we focus on Linux Lite.If you are handy with hardware and you can get your hands on a Dothan-class Intel Pentium M ™ CPU with a 400MHz front-side bus, replace the non-PAE Banias CPU with a Dothan. Dothans with 400MHz FSB are marked Pentium 7×5, i.e. 715, 725, 735, 745, 755 and 765.Which OS still supports 32bit Debian MX Linux MX-21_386 MX-21_386 Fluxbox Linux Mint All Options up to 19.3 Tricia NixOS - Scroll down to the NixOS: the Linux distribution section and click ISO then look for the Download (32 bit) button.

Having to twist my head to work on the server was not going to cut it and neither was removing all the monitors around it so I can take it down or move my connections around. I had to find a way to make this work as it was without breaking my neck.I know what you’re thinking at this point, just ssh into the thing, stop making life more complicated than it needs to be. Here’s the thing, I still need to build install the OS before I can get to ssh into it and I have income generating things running on the other monitors that I need to keep up all the time so I have no other option.Doing some research online I ran across fbcon or Framebuffer Console, from the fbcon manpage: The framebuffer console (fbcon), as its name implies, is a text console running on top of the framebuffer device. It has the functionality of any standard text console driver, such as the VGA console, with the added features that can be attributed to the graphical nature of the framebuffer.What are the features of fbcon? The framebuffer console supports high resolutions, varying font types, display rotation, primitive multihead, etc. Theoretically, multi-colored fonts, blending, aliasing, and any feature made available by the underlying graphics card are also possible.Framebuffer Console allows you to control features that can be attributed to the graphical nature of the framebuffer. The framebuffer console supports high resolutions, varying font types, display rotation, primitive multihead, etc. Theoretically, multi-colored fonts, blending, aliasing, and any feature made available by the underlying graphics card are also possible.For this purpose we’ll focus on the rotate option, fbcon=rotate:This option changes the orientation angle of the console display. The value ‘n’ accepts the following: 0 - normal orientation (0 degree) 1 - clockwise orientation (90 degrees) 2 - upside down orientation (180 degrees) 3 - counterclockwise orientation (270 degrees)The angle can be changed anytime afterwards by ‘echoing’ the same numbers to any one of the 2 attributes found in /sys/class/graphics/fbcon rotate - rotate the display of the active console rotate_all - rotate the display of all consolesConsole rotation will only become available if Console Rotation Support is compiled in your kernel. This is purely console rotation. Any other applications that use the framebuffer will remain at their ‘normal’ orientation. Actually, the underlying fb driver is totally ignorant of console rotation.Rotate all the frame buffers by running the following command: Make sure you change the rotation value to reflect the rotation of your display as noted above (options are 0 -3). Mine rotates country-clockwise so I selected clockwise (1) rotation to match. You can always try the echo command with the different options until it works if you’re not 100% sure then update GRUB to match.echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/graphics/fbcon/rotate_allEdit /etc/default/grub, find the line named GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX and add fbcon=rotate:1, so it looks like this:GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=&quot;fbcon=rotate:1&quot;Now run sudo update-grub and sudo update-grub2 to make the change take effect." }, { "title": "Configuring MTU", "url": "/posts/setting_mtu/", "categories": "Networking, MTU", "tags": "networking, configuration, mtu", "date": "2022-02-10 09:17:00 -0600", "snippet": "I recently had some issues with networking on a computer and one advice I got was to check the MTU setting. This isn’t something that one would normally need to mess with but it does apparently come up every now and again and there isn’t much information on how to do this unless you are a network engineer. Looking online I came across this old tutorial that is no longer available and thought I’d resrrect it for my reference and for others that may encounter the need to adjust their MTU settings. This is copied verbatim from the original poster with a few formatting changes onlyHow to determine the Max MTU size for an optimal internet connectionInformation on the Internet is transferred in packets. The MTU setting controls the maximum Ethernet packet size your PC or Router will send.Although larger packets can be constructed and sent, your ISP and Internet backbone routers and equipment will chop up (fragment) any packets larger than their limit. These parts are then reassembled by the target equipment before reading. This fragmentation and reassembly is not optimal.MTU and Windows and DefaultsWindows default MTU is 1500, or 576 for external networks. 1500 is OK unless you are running PPPoE, want to use IPSec (Secure VPN’s) or both, then it’s too big. 576 is too small, and inefficient for broadband Internet!Procedure to find optimal MTUIf your MTU is currently set too low, for example 576, the following procedure will not be able to detect whether you have discovered the “Optimal MTU size”. First reset the MTU setting of your equipment to 1500, the maximum size it could possibly be. For PPPoE, your Max MTU should be no more than 1492 to allow space for the 8 byte PPPoE “wrapper”. 1492 + 8 = 1500. From there it is possible to experiment and find the optimal MTU value. For PPPoE, the stakes are high: if you get your MTU wrong, you may not just be sub-optimal, things like uploading files, or the loading of web pages may stall, or not work at all! The ping test we will be doing does not include the IP/ICMP header of 28 bytes. 1500 – 28 = 1472. Include the 8 byte PPPoE wrapper if your ISP uses PPPoE and you get 1500 – 28 – 8 = 1464. The reason for these numbers will be apparent very soon.To find out if your packets are getting fragmented, we use a Ping command from the command prompt.The best value for MTU is that value just before your packets get fragmented. Add 28 to the largest packet size that does not result in fragmenting the packets (since the ping command specifies the ping packet size, not including the IP/ICMP header of 28 bytes), and this is your Max MTU setting.WindowsGo to Start → Programs → Accessories → Command Prompt and type (or Copy and Paste) the following: If you connect to your ISP using PPPoE: ping -f -l 1464 www.dslreports.com If you are not connecting to your ISP through PPPoE: ping -f -l 1472 www.dslreports.com That is a dash lower case “L,” not a dash “1.” Also note the spaces in between the sections.LinuxOpen your Terminal and use the following options: If you connect to your ISP using PPPoE: ping -s 1464 www.dslreports.com If you are not connecting to your ISP through PPPoE: ping -s 1472 www.dslreports.com macOSOpen your Terminal and use the following options: If you connect to your ISP using PPPoE: ping -D -s 1464 www.dslreports.com If you are not connecting to your ISP through PPPoE: ping -D -s 1472 www.dslreports.com Linux and OS X commands ARE case sensitive.NextPress Enter If you get the packet needs to be fragmented error message, then reduce the initial 1464 / 1472 by 10 until you no longer get the error message. Then increase the setting by 1 until you are 1 away from (less than) getting the packet needs to be fragmented error message again. If you can ping through with the number at 1464 (for PPPoE) / 1472 (for non-PPPoE), with no error message, you are done! Stop. Add 28 to the highest number pinged with no error (for both PPPoE and non-PPPoE), and that sum is your Max MTU setting. Use that (calculated sum) Max MTU setting in your router, or on your PC if your PC connects directly to your modem.ReferenceThe original site is no longer up and this was only located on the WayBack Machine here." }, { "title": "Reinstalling macOS", "url": "/posts/reinstall_macos/", "categories": "Apple, macOS", "tags": "apple, macos, install", "date": "2022-02-07 09:17:00 -0600", "snippet": "We’ve all gotten to the point where our computer needs a refresh, happens with Windows, it happens with Linux and it sure as heck happens with macOS as well. Either you mess something up, it’s starting to show its age or you are planning on selling it or giving it away.This article will cover how to create an install media as well as wipe and reinstall macOS, it will not go over backing up your data, you should know how to do that or should know how to search online for instructions.Creating a bootable installer A USB flash drive or other secondary volume formatted as Mac OS Extended, with at least 14GB of available storage A downloaded installer for macOS Monterey, Big Sur, Catalina, Mojave, High Sierra, or El CapitanDownload macOS Download: macOS Monterey, macOS Big Sur, macOS Catalina, macOS Mojave, or macOS High Sierra These download to your Applications folder as an app named Install macOS version_name. If the installer opens after downloading, quit it without continuing installation. To get the correct installer, download from a Mac that is using macOS Sierra 10.12.5 or later, or El Capitan 10.11.6. Enterprise administrators, please download from Apple, not a locally hosted software-update server. Download: OS X El Capitan This downloads as a disk image named InstallMacOSX.dmg. On a Mac that is compatible with El Capitan, open the disk image and run the installer within, named InstallMacOSX.pkg. It installs an app named Install OS X El Capitan into your Applications folder. You will create the bootable installer from this app, not from the disk image or .pkg installer. Use the ‘createinstallmedia’ command in Terminal Connect the USB flash drive or other volume that you’re using for the bootable installer. Open Terminal, which is in the Utilities folder of your Applications folder. Type or paste one of the following commands in Terminal. These assume that the installer is in your Applications folder, and MyVolume is the name of the USB flash drive or other volume you’re using. If it has a different name, replace MyVolume in these commands with the name of your volume.Monterey:*sudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Monterey.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolumeBig Sur:*sudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Big\\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolumeCatalina:*sudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Catalina.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolumeMojave:*sudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ Mojave.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolumeHigh Sierra:*sudo /Applications/Install\\ macOS\\ High\\ Sierra.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolumeEl Capitan:sudo /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyVolume --applicationpath /Applications/Install\\ OS\\ X\\ El\\ Capitan.app If your Mac is using macOS Sierra or earlier, include the --applicationpath argument and installer path, similar to the way this is done in the command for El Capitan.After typing the command: Press Return to enter the command. When prompted, type your administrator password and press Return again. Terminal doesn’t show any characters as you type your password. When prompted, type Y to confirm that you want to erase the volume, then press Return. Terminal shows the progress as the volume is erased. After the volume is erased, you may see an alert that Terminal would like to access files on a removable volume. Click OK to allow the copy to proceed. When done, the volume will have the same name as the installer, such as Install macOS Monterey. You can now quit Terminal and eject the volume. Using the bootable installerDetermine whether you’re using a Mac with Apple silicon (see Mac computers with Apple silicon below), then follow the appropriate steps:Apple silicon Plug the bootable installer into a Mac that is connected to the internet and compatible with the version of macOS you’re installing. Turn on your Mac and continue to hold the power button until you see the startup options window, which shows your bootable volumes. Select the volume containing the bootable installer, then click Continue. When the macOS installer opens, follow the onscreen instructions.Intel processor Plug the bootable installer into a Mac that is connected to the internet and compatible with the version of macOS you’re installing. Press and hold the alt ⌥ key immediately after turning on or restarting your Mac. Release the Option key when you see a dark screen showing your bootable volumes. Select the volume containing the bootable installer. Then click the up arrow or press Return. If you can’t start up from the bootable installer, make sure that the External Boot setting in Startup Security Utility (see Startup Security Utility below) is set to allow booting from external media.

Your Mac starts up from macOS Recovery. When you’re asked to select a user you know the password for, select the user, click Next, then enter their administrator password. When you see the macOS utilities window, choose Utilities &amp;gt; Startup Security Utility from the menu bar. When you’re asked to authenticate, click Enter macOS Password, then choose an administrator account and enter its password.Set a firmware passwordYou can use a firmware password to prevent anyone who doesn’t have the password from starting up from a disk other than your designated startup disk. To set a firmware password in Startup Security Utility, click Turn On Firmware Password, then follow the onscreen instructions. Learn more about firmware passwords.You can also disallow booting from external or removable media to prevent even those who know the firmware password from starting up from such media.Change Secure Boot settingsUse these settings to make sure that your Mac always starts up from a legitimate, trusted operating system.Full SecurityFull Security is the default setting, offering the highest level of security.During startup, your Mac verifies the integrity of the operating system (OS) on your startup disk to make sure that it’s legitimate. If the OS is unknown or can’t be verified as legitimate, your Mac connects to Apple to download the updated integrity information it needs to verify the OS. This information is unique to your Mac, and it ensures that your Mac starts up from an OS that is trusted by Apple.If FileVault is enabled while your Mac is attempting to download updated integrity information, you’re asked to enter a password to unlock the disk. Enter your administrator password, then click Unlock to complete the download. If the OS doesn’t pass verification: macOS: An alert informs you that a software update is required to use this startup disk. Click Update to open the macOS installer, which you can use to reinstall macOS on the startup disk. Or click Startup Disk and choose a different startup disk, which your Mac will also attempt to verify. Windows: An alert informs you that you need to install Windows with Boot Camp Assistant. If your Mac can’t connect to the internet, it displays an alert that an internet connection is required. Check your internet connection, such as by choosing an active network from Wi-Fi status menu in the menu bar. Then click Try Again. Or click Startup Disk and choose a different startup disk. Or use Startup Security Utility to lower the security level Medium SecurityDuring startup when Medium Security is turned on, your Mac verifies the OS on your startup disk only by making sure that it has been properly signed by Apple (macOS) or Microsoft (Windows). This doesn’t require an internet connection or updated integrity information from Apple, so it doesn’t prevent your Mac from using an OS that is no longer trusted by Apple. If the OS doesn’t pass verification: macOS: An alert informs you that a software update is required to use this startup disk. Click Update to open the macOS installer, which you can use to reinstall macOS on the startup disk. This requires an internet connection. Or click Startup Disk and choose a different startup disk, which your Mac will also attempt to verify. Windows: An alert informs you that you need to install windows with Boot Camp Assistant. No SecurityNo Security doesn’t enforce any of the above security requirements for your startup disk.Set allowed boot mediaUse this feature to control whether your Mac can start up from external or removable media. The default, most secure setting is to disallow it. If you attempt to boot from such media and you get a warning that your security settings do not allow it, you can change the setting in Startup Security Utility.Your Mac doesn’t support booting from network volumes, whether or not you allow booting from external or removable media." }, { "title": "Gaming with pfSense", "url": "/posts/xbox_on_pfsense/", "categories": "Gaming, pfSense", "tags": "gaming, xbox, pc, pfsense", "date": "2022-02-01 09:17:00 -0600", "snippet": "I’m an avid Xbox gamer, started back in the early days with Halo and the OG Xbox.

Some examples of UPnP devices are printers, gaming consoles, WiFi devices, IP cameras, routers, mobile devices, and Smart TVs. Many games today require this to properly connect. With enabled UPnP, devices directly forward a port on your router and save you from manually forwarding ports.By default, most new routers come with UPnP enabled and many users are unaware that they’re at risk of a malware infection or a data breach.UPnP can also modify router settings to open ports into a firewall to facilitate the connection of devices outside of a network.

This helps with the limitation of IPv4 addressing as it allows a network to have unlimited internal hosts but only 1 address exposed to the global public network. For this use, we will want to enable Pure NAT.As per pfsense: Pure NAT:Enables NAT Reflection using only NAT rules in pf to direct packets to the target of the port forward. It has better scalability, but it must be possible to accurately determine the interface and gateway IP address used for communication with the target at the time the rules are loaded. There are no inherent limits to the number of ports other than the limits of the protocols. All protocols available for port forwards are supported. If servers are on the same subnet as clients, the Enable automatic outbound NAT for Reflection option will mask the source of the traffic so it flows properly back through the firewall. Click System → Advanced → Firewall &amp;amp; NAT Look for and set NAT Reflection mode for port forwards to Pure NAT Look for and enable Enable automatic outbound NAT for Reflection Click SaveUPnP ConcernsThe UPnP service becomes dangerous if it establishes connections with devices that are infected with malware. Such connections make DDoS attacks possible.The U.S Department of Homeland Security urged all businesses to disable their UPnP following a cyberattack in 2013 impacting tens of millions of devices. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) hosts a continuously updated list of Common Vulnerability Exposures (CVEs) for popular devices and software solutions that can be accessed here.More details about UPnP-specific vulnerabilities can be found on the Carnegie Mellon University website.Required PortsThis is why things get complicated without UPnP. This is not an exhaustive list of all the required ports for each gaming platform or game, it’s just an example of why UPnP is needed and the complexity you would need to go through to setup manual port forwarding if you’re a gamer.Destiny 2 Playstation 4 TCP: 1935, 3478-3480 UDP: 3074, 3478-3479 Xbox One TCP: 3074 UDP: 88, 500, 1200, 3074, 3544, 4500 PC TCP: UDP: 3074, 3097 Steam TCP: 27015-27030, 27036-27037 UDP: 3074, 3097, 4380, 27000-27031, 27036 Xbox Series X TCP: 3074 UDP: 88, 500, 1200, 3074, 3544, 4500 Playstation 5 TCP: 1935, 3478-3480 UDP: 3074, 3478-3479 Call of Duty PC TCP: 3074, 27014-27050 UDP: 3074, 3478, 4379-4380, 27000-27031, 27036 Playstation 4 TCP: 1935, 3478-3480 UDP: 3074, 3478-3479 Xbox One TCP: 3074 UDP: 88, 500, 3074-3075, 3544, 4500 Xbox Live Xbox One TCP: 53, 80, 3074 UDP: 53, 88, 500, 3074, 3544, 4500 PC TCP: 53, 80, 3074 UDP: 53, 88, 500, 3074, 3544, 4500 Xbox Series X TCP: 53, 80, 3074 UDP: 53, 88, 500, 3074, 3544, 4500 Xbox 360 TCP: 53, 80, 1863, 3074 UDP: 53, 88, 1863, 3074 PlayStation Network - Default General TCP: 3478-3480 UDP: 3478-3479 Playstation 5 TCP: 1935, 3478-3480 UDP: 3074, 3478-3479 Halo Infinite PC TCP: 3074 UDP: 88, 500, 3074-3075, 3544, 4500 Xbox One TCP: 3074 UDP: 88, 500, 3074-3075, 3544, 4500 Steam TCP: 3074, 27015, 27036 UDP: 88, 500, 3074-3075, 3544, 4500, 27015, 27031-27036 Xbox Series X TCP: 3074 UDP: 88, 500, 3074-3075, 3544, 4500 Halo: The Master Chief Collection Xbox One TCP: 3074 UDP: 88, 500, 3074, 3544, 4500 PC TCP: 3074 UDP: 88, 500, 3074, 3544, 4500 Steam TCP: 3074, 27015, 27036 UDP: 88, 500, 3074, 3544, 4500, 27015, 27031-27036 Xbox Series X TCP: 3074 UDP: 88, 500, 3074, 3544, 4500 Just to play with the above in consideration, you would need to port forward 69 ports individually.

Even Epson recommends going that route to setup your printer now, however, there is no integration for using the scanner in the muti-funtion/All-in-One printer world.I forgot to book mark this during all the tabs I had open trying to figure this out but it seems that the app will not continue being supported for too much longer. I called Google support and was told there is no work around for scanning on Chrome OS other than scanning to email if your device supports it or scan to a PC then migrating the file via USB to the Chrome OS device.How to get it to workingAssigning a static IPThe first thing you will want to do is assign your printer a static IP. For this you will need to get the MAC Address for the printer. To do this: Connect a network cable from your gateway/router to your printer and power on the printer if you have not as yet. Press the home button, if necessary. Select Settings. Select General Settings. Select Network Settings. Select Network Status. Select Print Status Sheet. Select Print.Once you have your MAC Address, log into your router and go to the DHCP page. For me (remember I’m on pfSense), it’s under Services → DHCP4 Server. Click the add button and enter the details you are asked for.Now restart your printer and print another Network Status sheet as you did to get the MAC Address. Once you verify the printer was assigned the static IP Address, move on to the next section. If not, go back to your DHCP settings and make sure you entered everything right.Tip: You can also browse to IP Address in your browser so you don’t have to keep going back and forth to the printer.Configure Chrome OSThis is the easy part. Install Epson iPrint Launch iPrint If you did the last part correct, iPrint should automatically discover the printer. If not continue. Click on the Printer is not selected. Tap here to select a printer. banner Your printer should show up in the Local tab, if not … Click on the Manual IP tab Click the Add button at the bottom Enter the IP address you assigned the printer.
