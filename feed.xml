About 2 weeks ago I had some electrical work done on my house and had two new outlet drops added in my home office so I can install some much needed equipment.

You can only install 32bit OSs on these CPUs. I recently had someone ask if they could install an OS on one of these machines and I had to look this up again. I am still in the proc... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Rotate Linux Server Display using fbcon</title><link href="https://aphive.github.io/posts/frame_buffer_console/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rotate Linux Server Display using fbcon" /><published>2022-02-11T03:17:00-06:00</published> <updated>2022-02-11T03:17:00-06:00</updated> <id>https://aphive.github.io/posts/frame_buffer_console/</id> <content src="https://aphive.github.io/posts/frame_buffer_console/" /> <author> <name>{"name"=>"Aphive", "link"=>"https://github.com/aphive"}</name> </author> <category term="Linux" /> <category term="Configuration" /> <summary> On my wall of monitors that are hard mounted on my wall, I had one unused monitor that is in vertical (Portrait) mode that I wanted to use to plug in a server I was building out. Having to twist my head to work on the server was not going to cut it and neither was removing all the monitors around it so I can take it down or move my connections around. I had to find a way to make this work as it... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Configuring MTU</title><link href="https://aphive.github.io/posts/setting_mtu/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Configuring MTU" /><published>2022-02-10T09:17:00-06:00</published> <updated>2022-02-10T09:17:00-06:00</updated> <id>https://aphive.github.io/posts/setting_mtu/</id> <content src="https://aphive.github.io/posts/setting_mtu/" /> <author> <name>{"name"=>"Aphive", "link"=>"https://github.com/aphive"}</name> </author> <category term="Networking" /> <category term="MTU" /> <summary> I recently had some issues with networking on a computer and one advice I got was to check the MTU setting. This isn’t something that one would normally need to mess with but it does apparently come up every now and again and there isn’t much information on how to do this unless you are a network engineer. Looking online I came across this old tutorial that is no longer available and thought I... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Reinstalling macOS</title><link href="https://aphive.github.io/posts/reinstall_macos/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Reinstalling macOS" /><published>2022-02-07T09:17:00-06:00</published> <updated>2022-02-07T09:17:00-06:00</updated> <id>https://aphive.github.io/posts/reinstall_macos/</id> <content src="https://aphive.github.io/posts/reinstall_macos/" /> <author> <name>{"name"=>"Aphive", "link"=>"https://github.com/aphive"}</name> </author> <category term="Apple" /> <category term="macOS" /> <summary> We’ve all gotten to the point where our computer needs a refresh, happens with Windows, it happens with Linux and it sure as heck happens with macOS as well.
